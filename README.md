The program is used as a conduit for sharing and listening to local music files through
uploading. It consists of online chatting/listening rooms that can host music files and
facilitate interactions between users and enables them to create groups to listen to music
together, potentially in sync. The program could possibly contain one or more of the
following features.
Users could create accounts to potentially create chatting rooms, either public or private.
Private chatting rooms could be accessed through a private link sent to users who could
join as guests or through signed up accounts. Any guest or users with existing accounts
could join the public chatting rooms with no restrictions. Public room could be visible
through a sorting feature for the preferable genre of chatting room (i.e. Pop music, Jazz,
etc.) that could be eventually joined.

This project has been done by Leen Al-Jallad, Balaaj Arbab, Hala Elewa, Daniel Shobit Herbert, Samsara May Leung.
